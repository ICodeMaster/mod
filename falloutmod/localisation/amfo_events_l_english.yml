news.313.d:0 "Local sources claim that prisoners at the New California Republic Correctional Facility have succesfully rioted, using the dynamite they were using for the rail tracks to seize control of the prison. \n \n New Vegas authorities have warned to stay away from these prisoners, and the question remains - why haven't the NCR got this under control?"
news.313.a:0 "Shocking!"
news.313.b:0 "Freedom!"
news.313.c:0 "Curses!"

ces.1.t:0 "The Sacking of New Canaan"
ces.1.d:0 "As ordered by Caesar, the White Legs Tribe have attacked and destroyed New Canaan. They have slaughtered the Mormons and razed the city to the ground, that they then salted to ensure there could never be any growth. One of the terms of their attack on New Canaan was absorption into the Legion. What is the Caesar's will?"
ces.1.a:0 "They have done as ordered, absorb them."
ces.1.b:0 "But the Malpais Legate escaped, they have failed."
ces.2.t:0 "Caesar's Death"
ces.2.d:0 "Today, Caesar, our glorious leader, passed away. The heir apparent is Legate Lanius, but he is a brutal man and many are critical of his leadership. Vulpes Inculta, who was the leader of the frumentarii, now offers himself as an opponent, but many are critical of his lack of honour and proposal of a new way."
ces.2.a:0 "Lanius is the rightful heir!"
ces.2.b:0 "Lanius is too brutal, Inculta is the right choice."
choose_lanius:0 "Legate Lanius will become the new Caesar, but Vulpes Inculta will start a civil war"
choose_inculta:0 "Vulpes Inculta will take control, but Lanius' followers in the east will rise against him"
news.314.t:0 "Caesar Dies"
news.314.d:0 "Today, the leader of Caesar's Legion died in his sleep. Many Legionnaire's have reportedly fled the Mojave, and many tribes have apparently descended into chaos without the leadership of Caesar. \n \n The New California Republic celebrate, but are wary as to what will happen to Caesar's Legion now. \n \n Across the Colorado, there is now a large power vaccuum. The question on everybody's lips is 'Who will take Caesar's place?'"
news.314.a:0 "What now?"
news.314.b:0 "A damn shame."
news.315.t:0 "New Augustus Crowned"
news.315.d:0 "Today, after the long and bloody civil war that consumed Caesar's Legion, [CES.GetLeader] has been crowned as the new Augustus. \n \n This coronation marks the end of the civil war that followed Caesar's death, and legitimises [CES.GetLeader] as the rightful heir to Caesar and the new office of Augustus, Emperor of Caesar's Legion."

news.315.b:0 "Ave, true to [CES.GetLeader]."
news.316.t:0 "Nipton Burning"
news.316.d:0 "NCR scouts report that the town of Nipton has been attacked and ravaged by Caesar's Legion. Smoke can be seen from the Mojave outpost, and when investigated, the town was totally destroyed, with the crucified bodies of many Powder Gangers found throughout the town. \n \n The Legion has rarely been seen across the river since the First Battle for Hoover Dam, so this event seems to foreshadow greater, worse things on the horizon."
news.316.a:0 "Horrible!"
news.316.b:0 "Let them quake in their boots."
ces.7.t:0 "New Vegas"
ces.7.d:0 "The Omertas have been Legion agents for quite some time, now, if we can blackmail the White Glove Society, who we know to be cannibals, onto our side, then we could have a significant foothold in New Vegas that would help us win the 2nd Battle of Hoover Dam"
ces.7.a:0 "Blackmail them."
ces.7.b:0 "No, we will take Vegas by force!"
ces.4.t:0 "Securitron Vault"
ces.4.d:0 "Beneath the Fort is a vault with the markings of Vegas. After Caesar issued the command to investigate this, a way in was discovered. After a long fight with robot guardians of the place, a great vault of Securitrons was discoverd. \n \n Now the question is posed, do we activate them and attempt to comandeer them for ourselves, or destroy the vault?"
ces.4.a:0 "Add them to our Legion!"
ces.4.b:0 "Destroy the vault."
ces.5.t:0 "Great Khans"
ces.5.d:0 "The Great Khans have pledged themselves to us a while ago, unless the NCR has meddled in our deal, they should be prepared to take up arms for us in this battle."
ces.5.a:0 "Call them to arms!"
ces.6.t:0 "The Boomers"
ces.6.d:0 "The Boomers' artillery will be incredibly useful when attacking Hoover Dam. If their opinion of us is high enough, we can ally with them. Otherwise, we can take their artillery by force."
ces.6.a:0 "Ally with them."
ces.6.b:0 "Take it with force."
ces.8.t:0 "Kill President Kimball"
ces.8.d:0 "With the battle for Hoover Dam on the horizon, we could assasinate the NCR leader, President Aaron Kimball, to destabilize them somewhat and make them easier to conquer."
ces.8.a:0 "Go through with the plan."
ces.8.b:0 "There is no honour in assasination."
ncr.1.t:0 "The Boomers"
ncr.1.d:0 "The Boomers would be an effective ally in Vegas, and their artillery would be invaluable in our defence of Hoover Dam. We should attempt to ally with them, or we may have to take their artillery by force."
ncr.1.a:0 "Send a diplomat."
ncr.1.b:0 "They would not ally with us."
ncr.2.t:0 "The Great Khans"
ncr.2.d:0 "The Great Khans have been an enemy of the NCR for ages, and seem to want to ally themselves with Caesar. We can change this diplomatically, if the right leadership is installed, or we can preemptively destroy the Khans."
ncr.2.a:0 "A sympathetic leader is installed."
ncr.2.b:0 "It is not worth the risk."
ncr.3.t:0 "New Vegas"
ncr.3.d:0 "Mr House is a wild card, and his own eyes set on Hoover Dam. Though he has been good to the NCR, he is an enemy of the Republic, and he must be removed from power if we are to succeed. If we sponsor NCR rule in New Vegas they can join us peacefully, otherwise we will need to remove him violently."
ncr.3.a:0 "Vegas will join us."
ncr.3.b:0 "We must remove all our enemies."
ncr.4.t:0 "The Brotherhood"
ncr.4.d:0 "We have discovered that the Brotherhood of Steel, who we have warred with in the past, still has an outpost in the Mojave. This is an enemy that must be removed before we can take the Mojave, either diplomatically or violently."
ncr.4.a:0 "I choose peace."
ncr.4.b:0 "They must be destroyed."
